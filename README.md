### 1. Abstract <a name="abstract"/>

The present repository contains simple algorithms wrotted using Python language. The initial idea was make quick start about that language. To esily reference the algorithms, we call him just by number, for exemple, to say something about exer-1, the short documentation call this by 1.

### 2. Algorithms description table <a name="table"/>
